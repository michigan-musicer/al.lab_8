English-language slidedeck and instructions for lab 8 in AL Basics of Programming class.

# Instructions for class

Complete the survey and create accounts, per the instructions below. 

When you are creating the accounts, use your non-school email. Your school email will expire after you graduate, and so will all of your accounts.

## 1. Complete a survey

Please fill out this survey to help me improve my teaching.

## 2. Create a GitHub account 

Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and register for an account using a non-school email.

To properly use GitHub, you need to know how to use the `git` tool. This can be difficult to learn solo, so if there is enough interest in a coding club, I would like to make environment setup + Git the first session we have together. If you want to try learning it solo, check out [https://learngitbranching.js.org/](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) and our university's `git` tutorial at [https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_git.html](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_git.html). Note that our university's tutorial is very specific to projects we do at our university - you will have to skip parts of the tutorial that are specific to the project. (This is part of the reason why I'd like to guide you guys through this myself.)

Consider looking through some of the online resources compiled by users for learning:

- https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs
- https://github.com/topics/learning-resources

## 3. Create a LeetCode account (or an account for another coding interview platform)

Go to [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/) and register for an account by clicking "Sign in" in the top right corner. If you prefer, you can sign up for Hackerrank instead at [https://www.hackerrank.com/](https://www.hackerrank.com/). Both sites provide the same fundamental service.

## 4. Create a LinkedIn account (or an account for another job application platform)

LinkedIn is the most commonly used professional platform. You can create an account here: [https://www.linkedin.com/](https://www.linkedin.com/) There are a few other platforms you might want to look at, including Indeed ([https://pl.indeed.com/?r=us](https://pl.indeed.com/?r=us)) and Blind ([https://www.teamblind.com/jobs](https://www.teamblind.com/jobs)). I personally use LinkedIn to find jobs and just apply to most jobs on company websites.

If you want to connect with me, my LinkedIn account is here: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-wang-978627196/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-wang-978627196/)

## 5. Explore!

I recommend looking at some of the LeetCode problems and trying out the easy ones. They may be too hard for you at this point (it takes most people one year of experience to start solving), but it's good to get a sense of what will be asked of you in the future.

You can also browse some of the suggested GitHub links above, or look at job postings in Warsaw / Gdańsk / Kraków.
